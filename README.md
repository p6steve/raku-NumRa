# Num
some extensions to Raku arrays for scientific computing

work in progress

- this module is intended to bring Raku to a similar level of functionality as Python NumPy
- since Raku has substantial core support for arrays, this is a smaller footprint than it's Python equivalent
- existing Raku libraries such as Math::Matrix will be defined as dependencies where use'd

## Contribution

## Downstream

- this module is intended to facilitate downstream projects such as raku-Sci and raku-(analytics)
