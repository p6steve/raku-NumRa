# NumRa
some extensions to Raku arrays for scientific computing as an alternative to NumPy

work in progress

please see/comment via PR on the [backlog.md](https://github.com/p6steve/raku-NumRa/blob/main/backlog.md)

- this module is intended to bring Raku to a similar level of functionality as Python NumPy
- since Raku has substantial core support for arrays, this is a smaller footprint than it's Python equivalent
- existing Raku libraries such as Math::Matrix will be defined as dependencies where use'd
